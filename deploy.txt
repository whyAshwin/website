# Portfolio Website Deployment Guide

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free & Easy)

1. Create a GitHub repository for your portfolio
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio-website.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. Go to your repository Settings > Pages
   - Set source to "main" branch
   - Save and wait for the website to be deployed

3. Your website will be available at:
   `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/portfolio-website/`

## Option 2: Netlify/Vercel (Free & Easy)

1. Create an account on Netlify or Vercel
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the build settings (not required for static sites)
4. Deploy

## Option 3: Custom Domain

If you want to use a custom domain like `ashwinbaranwal.com`:

1. Purchase a domain from a registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Configure DNS settings to point to your hosting provider
   - If using GitHub Pages, add a CNAME file to your repository
   - If using Netlify/Vercel, you can configure the domain in their dashboard

## Local Development Server

To test your website locally before deploying:

```
# If you have Python installed
python -m http.server

# If you have Node.js installed
npx serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` or the port shown in your terminal.
